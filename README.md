# Pellet Stove Automation
A script for Raspberry Pi that can automate a pellet stove

This project is currently in the prototyping phase where I am attempting to gather data by manually operating each individual part of the stove.

The Testing Environment folder contains a gui that will allow the user to manually control the pellet stove. Future updates will call gpio pins to react to the button presses and data will be tracked and presented to user after the program finishes running.
